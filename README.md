# React Gapi Auth2

React bindings for `gapi.auth2` (Google's OAuth 2.0 JavaScript client)

## The Problem

You want to use the [`gapi.auth2`](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/reference) api to implement "Sign in with Google" in your React app. However, you don't want to [use the api directly](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) because,

- You don't want to load `<script />` tags manually, as suggested in the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
- You prefer to write declarative code and `gapi.auth2` is an imperative api

## This Solution

// TODO
